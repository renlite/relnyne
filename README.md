# Declarative Style for [Fyne UI](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne) 

This library is still in development and is not ready to be used.

Relnyne is a very lightweigt extention of [Fyne Widgets](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/tree/master/widget) to describe the UI in a declarative way and offers a simple data and state container to manage the state and update.
